My name is Alexandr Shubin, currently I am a student of Tomsk State
University in Russia. I would like to become a frontend-developer.
I profoundly believe that continuous education and practical skills improvement are essential
for being an expert programmer. Since I want to become an excellent specialist in the area, I
feel the great necessity of broadening of my horizons by taking rs-school frontend course.
I examined closely the curriculum of the program offered by the rs-school, and I
am certain that taking the opportunity to study this course is precisely what would let
me do it, and become a competent contributor to the community.
My interest in the area of frontend development first arose during the years of my
bachelor studies at Tomsk State University.
